Hagios Demetrios) is dedicated to Saint Demetrius, the patron saint of Thessaloniki (formerly the second largest city of the Byzantine Empire).  Demetrius was a Christian Roman soldier who was imprisoned in a Roman bath formerly on this site.  He was executed in 306 by order of Emperor Galerius (who persecuted many early Christians).  The bath was replaced by a church in the early 4th century, which was replaced by a larger, three-aisled basilica about a century later.  The basilica was replaced by a five-aisled basilica in 629–634 (appearing much as it is today).  St. Demetrius' martyrdom site is now a large crypt underneath the church.  His remains are in a beautiful wood and silver reliquary (called a ciborium).  The basilica has six mosaics from the 7th century depicting St. Demetrius with church officials and with children.  Thessaloniki became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1430, and in 1493 Bayezid II converted the church into the Kasımiye Camii (mosque), plastering over the frescoes and mosaics.   In 1913 the basilica reverted to a Christian church after the Greek conquest.  The Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 destroyed the roof and upper walls of the basilica, which was restored in the 1940s by Greek and Nazi German authorities.  Artifacts from archaeological excavations in the 1930s and 1940s appear in a small museum inside the church's crypt. The Church of Saint Demetrius was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.  The church is open from 6am-10pm every day (the crypt is open 8am-2pm Wed-Mon).

He was the son of a wealthy military commander of Thessaloniki and received a good education as a child. He also joined the army and became an officer. When he was young, he decided to secretly baptized Christian, something forbidden those years.When his father died, the Roman Emperor Maximian ordered him to chase and kill the Christians of Thessaloniki. Dimitrios refused to do so and revealed his faith. He was asked to change his religious beliefs but refused once again and expressed his disgust for idolatry. Therefore, he was put to prison, was tortured and died for his God. Before he died, he donated all his wealth to the poor. His bravery and sacrifice made him an Orthodox saint. Later years people built a small church on the martyrdom of Agios Dimitrios. Over the years the church has become magnificent and significant.The Ottomans made Agios Dimitrios a mosque, and plastered over frescoes that were again revealed after the 1913 Greek reconquest. While the city's devastating fire of 1917 was very damaging, five 8th-century mosaics survive, spanning the altar.The martyrdom site is now an underground crypt. The Crypt and underground site is especially  interesting place.

Unusually, it did not hold any physical relics of the saint. The ciborium seems to have been a symbolic tomb. It was rebuilt at least once.Nave with rests of applicated light and dark fields of the archesThe basilica is famous for six extant mosaic panels, dated to the period between the latest reconstruction and the inauguration of the Iconoclastic policies in 730. These mosaics, depicting St. Demetrius with officials responsible for the restoration and with children, represent rare examples of art surviving from the Dark Age that followed Justinian's death. An inscription below one of the images glorifies heaven for saving the people of Saloniki from a pagan Slavic raid in 612. Other magnificent mosaics, recorded as covering the church interior, were lost either during the four centuries when it functioned as a mosque (1493–1912) or in the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 that destroyed much of the city. It also destroyed the roof and upper walls of the church. Following the Great Fire of 1917, it took decades to restore the church. Archeological excavations conducted in the 1930s and 1940s revealed interesting artifacts that may be seen in a museum situated inside the church's crypt. The excavations also uncovered the ruins of a Roman bath, where St. Demetrius was said to have been held prisoner and executed. A Roman well was also discovered. Scholars believe this is where soldiers dropped the body of St. Demetrius after his execution.

The church has been twice destroyed by fire, the first suggested to have occurred between AD 629-634.The mosaics are suggested to date to the period shortly thereafter. Of these the single most important mosaic is the vertical panel depicting St. Demetrius with a bishop and secular official. The design of the figure of the saint is stylized, somewhat flat, and abstract. This is in contrast to the style of the two figures flanking him. They are well modeled and robust with finely articulated physiognomies. These differences enable one to appreciate how two artistic styles are used to convey the spiritual-- deceased martyr-- and the living--clerical and secular. The saint's halo is round, the others rectangular, representing yet another visual clue toward understanding the differences inherent between the two. The church was  eventually converted into a mosque, which accounts for the stippling on its frescoes intended to hold the plaster which was pasted over them. A second fire in 1927 destroyed much of the church, but led to the accidental discovery of the crypt. The preservation of the remains of the church was completed in 1948. The church and its mural decoration retain their deserved position in the history of Byzantine art.

The Derveni Papyrus, Greece’s oldest surviving papyrus piece (320–250 BC), is recognized by UNESCO as Europe's oldest 'book'.  A courtyard on the southwest side contains architectural fragments and sarcophagi (mostly from the classical period) and may be entered without charge.

Most of the exhibits have been dug up, recovered from graves or found as bits of other buildings.There are exquisite pieces of gold jewelry, expertly decorated pots, wonderfully carved sculptures in stone and marble, ordinary household items and even, in one exhibit, human hair and gold decorated cloth from a lead lined coffin in which decay was inhibited.I was particularly impressed by the cases in which gold and other articles were displayed, with finely crafted lighting that showed off the exhibits at their best.The museum has interior exhibits and, with free access, external displays of sarcophagi that provide stories of the inhabitants, their families, their politics and the touching sorrows that accompany death, particularly of children.

The Derveni Papyrus left me stunned for some time, and I could have sat trying to read it all day. Here we have words written possibly by Euthyphro, a man who I've encountered in the Platonic dialogues, the texts that Western Civilisation and the Academic Principle are based, and here is his actual writing before me to read. It's even possible that Socrates himself read these words, and now here am I reading them. I can only say this was a truly awe-inspiring moment for me. The museums has many other treasures, the gold exhibition had some really stunning pieces that were so delicate it's a miracle they've survived, and the collection of Neolithic art I found very beautiful.
